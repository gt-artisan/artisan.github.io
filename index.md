## Mission

ARTISAN advances **AI-enabled scientific discovery** through interdisciplinary research, 
open-source cyberinfrastructure, and scalable computing platforms.

We focus on reducing friction in computational science — enabling researchers to move seamlessly from interactive local exploration to large-scale, reproducible experiments on shared and national resources.
