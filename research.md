# Interdisciplinary Research

ARTISAN sits at the intersection of **AI**, **cyberinfrastructure**, and **computational science**.

## Themes
- **End-to-end research workflows** (from interactive setup to scale-out runs)
- **Reproducibility & provenance** (traceable computational experiments)
- **Gateway ecosystems** (community-facing science platforms)

## Example Areas
- Computational chemistry workflows and automation
- Neuroscience modeling pipelines (e.g., simulation orchestration)
- Earth science data platforms and analysis services
