# Nexus

**Nexus** is a platform for seamlessly moving between **local interactive computing** and **remote scalable resources**.

## Principles
- **Local-first:** keep scientists in their natural interactive environment
- **Seamless scale-up:** expand to HPC/cloud when needed, without context switching
- **Lower barriers:** onboarding and access should be fast and intuitive

## Platform building blocks (examples)
- Federated identity & centralized user profile
- Allocation management across resources
- Resource account mapping and automation
- Workflow utilities and monitoring integration
